<h1>Initial Commit.</h1>

<p></p>

<p>Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating
  his sister. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Your head is not an artifact! For
  an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Fate. It
  protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Is it my
  imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? We
  know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination
  attempt on <a href="#">Lieutenant Worf</a>. Well, that's certainly good to know. Why don't we
  just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? I'll be
  sure to note that in my log. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with
  Geordi, or Worf. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000
  kilometers. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history
  of Starfleet. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! You enjoyed that. But the probability
  of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. I am your worst
  nightmare! This should be interesting. Besides, you look good in a dress.</p>

<h2>We know you're dealing in stolen ore.</h2>

<p> But I wanna talk about the
  assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Yesterday I did not know how to eat
  gagh. For <a href="#">an android with no feelings, he sure managed to</a> evoke them in
  others. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I recommend you
  don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. A surprise party? Mr. Worf,
  I hate surprise parties.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I would *never* do that to you.</li>
  <li>That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of
    Starfleet.</li>
  <li>Besides, you look good in a dress.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Your shields
  were failing, sir. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Flair is what
  marks the difference between artistry and mere competence.</p>

<h2>Computer, belay that order.</h2>

<p>Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that
  knows us better than we know ourselves? Wouldn't that bring about chaos? We
  know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination
  attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur,
  wholeheartedly! The unexpected is our normal routine. Besides, you look good
  in a dress. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? For an
  android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. A surprise
  party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. The
  Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Now we know what they mean by
  'advanced' tactical training. Flair is what marks the difference between
  artistry and mere competence. Did you come here for something in particular or
  just general Riker-bashing? Maybe we better talk out here; the observation
  lounge has turned into a swamp.</p>
